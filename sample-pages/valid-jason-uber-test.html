    We can have text here

    X<p>This is allowed</p>X
    X<div>This is allowed</div>X
    X<span>So is this</span>X
    X<br id="SoIsThis">X

                                                Why would this be here.
                                                Seriously.
    Here we go...
    X<div>a<div>this is allowed</div>a</div>X
    X<div>a<div>a<p>so is this</p>a</div>a</div>X
